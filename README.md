# STM32_FromScratch
A repo that set's up an environment from scratch for stm32F4 (Linker script, startup file, makefile, ....) 

I am writing an article how i start at STM32 From Scratch, you can read it here [artcile](articles/Fromscratch.md)
/bin/bash: line 1: a: command not found
the [template_directory](./Template_proj) contains a more elaborate environment that is developped by ST ( `linker file` `startup file` and `libray` contains the STM32F4xx headers needed  )
